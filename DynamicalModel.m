function [M,C,N] = DynamicalModel(T,J)
    %	This function should take whatever it needs to build a dynamical model for the robot 
    
    %   I'm not sure about the input, but I think it definately needs to take T&J
    %   to calculate the M,C,N matrixes
    
    % The output of this function should be a symbolic expression of M,C,N matrixes 
    M = inputArg1;
    C = inputArg2;
    N = inputArg2;
